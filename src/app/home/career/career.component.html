          Graduated in Business and went straight into the thrilling world of retail banking.
          Mastered the art of selling capitalization bonds and pretending cold calls were fun.

          Decided to give code a shot and applied to a bootcamp.
          Turns out 40,000 people had the same idea. 200 got in. I had no idea what a for-loop was, but they let me in anyway.
          Spent 6 months learning Java, HTML, and how to cry in CSS.

          Joined a startup. Wrote frontend that didn't look like 2009.
          Built a LinkedIn scraper, automated landing pages, stopped bots with CAPTCHA.
          Basically made the company money while Google was still indexing the homepage.

          Entered the telecom world. Built batch jobs that no human ever reads but the system loves.

          Built a Value at Risk platform used by 2,000+ users (yes, with Java and Spring Boot — the adult stuff).
          Developed an AI news tracker that actually understands headlines (and doesn’t freak out like humans).
          Placed 2nd in a hackathon with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that answered support questions better than
          our docs.
          Currently leading a tool to monitor credit exposure breaches, with automated alerts and audit-friendly dashboards.
