            Decided to give code a shot and applied to a bootcamp.
            Turns out 40,000 people had the same idea. 200 got in. I had no idea what a for-loop was, but they let me in
            anyway.
            Spent 6 months learning Java, HTML, and how to cry in CSS.

            Built a Value at Risk platform used by 2,000+ users (yes, with Java and Spring Boot — the adult stuff).
            Developed an AI news tracker that actually understands headlines (and doesn’t freak out like humans).
            Placed 2nd in a hackathon with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that answered support questions
            better
            than
            our docs.
